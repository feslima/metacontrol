===================
The "Metamodel" tab
===================

At this tab you will use the Design of Experiments (DOE) generated previously to
generate kriging metamodels of the initial sampling. The main idea here is to inspect if
the initial sampling providing is capable of predicting the basic form of the functions that you
chose/created on the first step (Objective Function, CV candidates and constraints). If the kriging generated 
by the initial sampling is good enough, you are able to optimize it and refine it on the next step.
On this tab you will be able to:

* Define the lower and upper bounds for the hyperparameters that will be adjusted to give the
  best kriging prediction
* Define the regression and correlation (kernel) model for your kriging interpolator
* Define which variables will have their kriging metamodel built
* Inspect several validation metrics in order to conclude if your model is a good representation
* Perform k-fold or hold-out validation. On the latter, you will be able to also inspect graphically
  your model.

Here is an overview of this tab:

   *Metacontrol* "Metamodel" tab.

There are six main panels on this tab:

* Hyperparameters (theta) definition *panel*
* Regression and Correlation (Kernel) model selection *panel*
* Type of validation *panel*
* Variable selection *panel*
* Results generation and validation *panel*
* Validation metrics *panel*

Hyperparameters (theta) definition *panel*
===========================================

This is the panel that you will define the upper and lower bounds of
the Hyperparameters (theta). There is one hyperparameter for each MV. The disturbances are 
only included at the "Reduced space" step, since we seek to use the first metamodel to optimize the
base case.

.. figure:: ../images/hyperparameter_main.png
   :align: center

   Hyperparameters (theta) definition *panel*. Note that the aliases that you chose for each MV
   are used all over you *Metacontrol* case study, including here.

.. IMPORTANT::
  Generally, you do not need to change from the
  defaults values used in *Metacontrol*, since internally *PyDACE* does a pretty good job in optimizing the
  Hyperparameters to maximize the likelihood. We recommend to change the bounds or even the 
  estimate only if you are not satisfied with the prediction produced. For the mathematical aspects and a deeper
  explanation on how the hyperparameters (and kriging itself) works, check our "Theoretical Backgrounds" Section.

Changing the bounds and estimate for the hyperparameters
---------------------------------------------------------

Simply double click on the upper/lower bound/estimate that you want to 
change and type it. Easy.

.. figure:: ../images/hyperparameter_change.png
   :align: center

   Changing bounds and estimates.

Regression and Correlation (Kernel) model selection *panel*
===========================================================

This panel is used to configure which regression and correlation (kernel) model
will be used in your kriging interpolator.

   :align: center

   Regression and Correlation (Kernel) model selection *panel*.


Selecting the regression and correlation models
------------------------------------------------

Just use the dropdown list to select the regression and correlation 
models.

.. figure:: ../images/reg_corr_panel_select.png
   :align: center

   For instance, selecting your regression model.

.. IMPORTANT::
    Currently, *Metacontrol* gives you the *constant*, *linear* and *quadratic* options for
    the regression model, and the *exponential* for the kernel. On future releases, different kernels
    will be added.


Type of validation *panel*
==========================

This panel will give you the possibility to opt between *hold-out* (leave-out) or *k-fold* types of validation.
The number of folds and the percentage of DOE data separated for the training set in the case of *hold-out* validation 
can also be configured.


.. figure:: ../images/val_type_main.png
   :align: center

   Type of validation *panel*.


Performing a *hold-out* Validation
-----------------------------------
Select the radio button for *hold-out* validation and define using the slider the percentage of the initial sampling
that is going to be used to build your model. The remaining will be used for test purposes.

.. figure:: ../images/val_holdout.png
   :align: center

   Configuring *hold-out* validation.

The *Metacontrol* default is to leave 75% of the DOE data for construction and the remaining for
validation purposes.



Performing a *k-out* Validation
--------------------------------

Select the radio button for *k-fold* validation and define the number of folds to be considered using the slider.

.. figure:: ../images/val_kfold.png
   :align: center

   Configuring *hold-out* validation.

.. IMPORTANT::
    For a theoretical background on *hold-out* and *k-fold* validation, refer to our papers and our theoretical 
    background section.

Variable selection *panel*
==========================

On this panel you can choose which variables will have their model built. *Metacontrol* gives you this feature
in order to give you the chance to inspect groups of variables, for instance.

Selecting a variable to have its model built
---------------------------------------------

Simply check the box for each Variable (Objective Function, CV candidate, constraint function) That you want to
inspect its kriging response:


.. figure:: ../images/metamodel_check_variable.png
   :align: center

   Selecting Variables.


Results generation and validation *panel*
==========================================

After configuring the hyperparameters bounds/estimates, choosing your kernel and regression models, selecting which variables
do you want to have kriging responses generated and the type of validation, you can use this panel to generate your kriging responses.

If you choose *k-fold* validation, you will see that the Validation metrics *panel* is now with several metrics to evaluate your kriging model.

If you choose *hold-out* validation, you will see that, in addition to the results of the Validation metrics *panel*, the button "View graphical results"
is available.

Graphically inspecting your results
------------------------------------

The classic predicted data *versus* validation data validation plots are available in *Metacontrol*, if you opted for *hold-out* validation. Simply click on
"View graphical results" button, and a screen with a plot for each variable that had its kriging response built will appear:

.. figure:: ../images/metamodel_graph_results.png
   :align: center

   Graphically inspecting your kriging metamodels fitness against validation data.

Taking a closer look to the "Validation Results" windows with the plots you can see a panel at the bottom with several buttons.
They allow you to:

* Reset the original view, if you change it
* Pan axes with left mouse, zoom with right
* Zoom to rectangle
* Configure subplots
* Edit axis, curve and image parameters
* Save the figure to use it elewhere.

.. figure:: ../images/graph_close.png
   :align: center

   Thanks to *matplotlib* package used in *Metacontrol*, you are able to perform several inspect operations and save your plot.




Validation metrics *panel*
===========================

This panel is completed after you generate your kriging metamodel. It allows you to see several metrics
in order to assure the robustness of you kriging response.


.. figure:: ../images/val_metric_main.png
   :align: center

   Validation metrics *panel*.

The metrics are:

* OMSE = Overall Mean-squared Error
* ORMSE = Overall Root Mean-squared Error
* OMAE = Overall Mean Absolute Error
* OR2  = RÂ² value
* OEV = Overall expected Variance
* Sample Mean
* Sample Standard deviation
